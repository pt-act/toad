# Toad notes

This is notes.md in the root of the repository.
I'm using this file to keep track of what works in Toad and what doesn't.


## What works

- ACP support broadly works, barring a few rough edges.
  - Slash commands  
  - Tools calls
  - Modes (only reported by Claude so far)
  - Terminal
- Settings (press `F2` or `ctrl+,`).
- Multiline prompt (should be intuitive)
- Shell commands
- Colors in shell commands

## What doesn't work (yet)

- Interactive shell commands / terminals
- File tree doesn't do much
- Some odd output in shell on Linux (working on a fix)
- Chat bots have been temporarily disabled
- No shell history
- No shell auto-complete
